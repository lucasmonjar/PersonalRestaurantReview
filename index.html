            <p class="box6">Personal Restaurant Review is a tool to help you order when you go to restaurants.
                Every time you go out to eat, log what you ordered and a review of that item.
                We will keep track of all of this information, then when the time comes to order again,
                you can see exactly what you've ordered at that restaurant before to help you decide whether
                you want to order the same thing, or something new!
